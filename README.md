# Motivation
I didn't have a personal website and I was looking for a job. Right now, it's basically a requirement everywhere to know your way with AI tools that help you code (Claude Code, Cursor, etc). Therefore, this project consists of me fighting my way to success using prompts (plus a bit of manual code tuning).

**DISCLAIMER**: This isn't in any way intended to demonstrate great code crafting, practices or quality. It's just me playing with AI for a bit.
